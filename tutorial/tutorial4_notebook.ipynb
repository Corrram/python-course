    "### Exercise 2: Basic Statistics with Python\n",
    "Use Python to perform basic statistical analysis on a dataset.  \n",
    "This exercise will introduce you to the `random` and [statistics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html) modules from Python's standard library.  \n",
    "Follow the steps below to practice generating random data and calculating basic statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, generate a list of 20 random integers between 1 and 100 using the [randint](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randint) function from the [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) module.  \n",
    "   This will help you practice creating random data.\n",
    "2. Next, use the `statistics` module to calculate the mean (average) of the generated list. The mean is an important measure in data analysis to determine the central value of the data.\n",
    "3. Then, calculate the median (the middle value) and mode (the most frequently occurring value) of the list to understand the distribution of your data.\n",
    "4. Finally, find the standard deviation of the list, which measures how spread out the numbers are in your dataset.\n"
