    "### Exercise 1: Collatz Conjecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The Collatz conjecture is a mathematical hypothesis that starts with any positive integer and follows a simple process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the number is even, divide it by 2.\n",
    "2. If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.\n",
    "3. Repeat this process until the number reaches 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, starting with the number 6, the sequence would be:\n",
    "6 → 3 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python program that takes an integer input and generates a list that shows the Collatz sequence starting from that number until it reaches 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example:\n",
    "- Input: `12` \n",
    "- Output: `[12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`"

    "### Exercise 2: Longest Substring in Alphabetical Order\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a string of lowercase letters. Your task is to determine the longest substring of letters that appear in alphabetical order. If there are multiple substrings of the same length, print the first one.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the string `abcfde`, the longest substring in alphabetical order is `abcf`. If the input string is `zyxwvuts`, the result would be `z` (since all the letters are in reverse order and no substring has more than one letter in alphabetical order).\n",

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.

We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\n",
