    "### Exercise 5 (Optional: Additional Python Resources for Data Science)\n",
    "\n",
    "To further strengthen your skills in Python for data analysis and visualization, consider completing the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Discover Additional Resources for Popular Python Packages**:  \n",
    "   - Read parts of [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) by Wes McKinney to enhance your knowledge of Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.  \n",
    "   - Check out [The Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by Jake VanderPlas, which covers essential tools like Matplotlib, SciPy, and Scikit-learn.  \n",
    "   - Review the [Matplotlib Cookbook](https://github.com/rougier/scientific-visualization-book) for hands-on examples of data visualization with Matplotlib.  \n",
    "   - Explore the documentation for [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) (for advanced statistical plots) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) (for interactive, web-based visualizations).  \n",
    "   - Visit [Claus Wilke's Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/) for advice on creating effective visualizations.  \n",
    "   - Dive into the [Scientific Python Lectures](https://lectures.scientific-python.org/) to deepen your understanding of Python in scientific computing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Practice and Apply Your Skills**:  \n",
    "   - Challenge yourself with Python exercises using NumPy and Pandas on platforms like [StrataScratch](https://www.stratascratch.com), which offers real-world datasets and interview questions.  \n",
    "   - Explore practical problems and datasets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Choose Your Own Project**:  \n",
    "   - Alternatively, pick a project or topic that interests you and apply the concepts you've learned to it.\n"
