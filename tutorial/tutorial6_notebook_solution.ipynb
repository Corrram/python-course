    "### Exercise 1: Robust Weather Analyzer\n",
    "Extend the `analyze_weather_data` function from the previous tutorial with exception handling. The function should handle the following exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the `data` parameter is not a list, raise a `TypeError` with the message: \"The data parameter must be a list!\".\n",
    "2. If the `analysis_type` parameter is not a string, raise a `TypeError` with the message: \"The analysis_type parameter must be a string!\".\n",
    "3. If the `analysis_type` parameter is not one of \"average\", \"max\", \"min\", or \"trend\", raise a `ValueError` with the message: \"The analysis_type parameter must be one of 'average', 'max', 'min', or 'trend'!\".\n",
    "4. If the `data` parameter is an empty list, raise a `ValueError` with the message: \"The data parameter must not be empty!\".\n",
    "5. *Advanced*: If the `data` parameter is a list of dictionaries, but one of the dictionaries does not have the keys \"date\", \"temperature\", \"humidity\", or \"wind_speed\", raise a `ValueError` with the message: \"The data parameter must be a list of dictionaries with the keys 'date', 'temperature', 'humidity', and 'wind_speed'!\".\n",
